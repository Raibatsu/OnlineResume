# OnlineResume
Fancy Resume online on WebGL

This resume couldn't have been made possible without: 
- [Miller](https://www.templatefoundation.com/previews/miller/index.html)
- [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/)
- [Zoraiz](https://github.com/TheZoraiz)


And of course, whosoever folks came up with Unity. Thank you [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/resume-and-cv_6614677) for the Resume PNG.
